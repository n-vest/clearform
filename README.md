## Overview

Clearform is a small consulting practice focused on improving how work moves through service-based organizations.

The work centers on clarifying workflows (intake, coordination, handoffs, follow-through) and selectively automating parts of those systems to reduce manual overhead while preserving reliability and human understanding.

## About this site

- Static HTML (no framework, no build step)
