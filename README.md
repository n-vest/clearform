# Clearform

This repository hosts the Clearform landing page, deployed via **GitHub Pages** as a project site under:

https://nicholasvest.com/clearform/

## What is Clearform?

Clearform is a small consulting practice focused on redesigning and automating everyday workflows for service-based organizations.

The emphasis is not one-size-fits-all automation, but **system design**: clarifying how work moves through an organization (intake, handoffs, coordination, follow-through) and then automating the right parts using modern tools.

The goal is to reduce busywork while keeping workflows understandable, reliable, and human-owned.

## About this site

- **Static HTML** (no framework, no build step)
- Deployed directly from the `main` branch using **GitHub Pages**
- Intended as a lightweight, low-friction signal page rather than a full product site
